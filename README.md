# Mathematics-in-Python
Mathematical concepts implemented and visualized using Python for Machine Learning and engineering practice.
# Mathematics in Python

This repository contains mathematical exercises implemented using Python.

The goal is to strengthen mathematical understanding through:
- Visualization of functions
- Numerical computation
- Linear algebra basics
- Calculus concepts
- Machine Learning related mathematics

Topics include:
- Polynomial functions
- Activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid)
- Linear algebra (vectors, matrices)
- Mathematical plotting with NumPy and Matplotlib

This repository is part of my learning journey toward Machine Learning and Neuroengineering.
